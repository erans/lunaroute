## Notes

1. **Parallel Work**: Testing (Phase 13) should run in parallel with development phases
2. **Dependencies**: Storage (Phase 2) blocks most other work
3. **MVP Target**: Phases 0-11 constitute the MVP
4. **Iterative Development**: Each phase should include tests and documentation
5. **Performance**: Optimization should be ongoing, not just Phase 14
6. **Security**: Security considerations should be built-in from Phase 0

## Risk Mitigation

- **Tool/Function Parity**: Gate behind feature flags initially
- **Pricing Drift**: Implement versioned price tables with validation
- **PII Recall**: Strict access controls and audit logging
- **Vendor Limits**: Clear error mapping and documentation
- **Performance**: Continuous profiling and optimization
