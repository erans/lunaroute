# LunaRoute

**Intelligent LLM API Gateway**

LunaRoute is a high-performance API gateway for Large Language Model providers, written in Rust. It provides intelligent routing, session recording, PII detection, budget management, and unified API translation between different LLM providers.

## Features

- **Unified API Translation**: Seamlessly translate between OpenAI and Anthropic API formats
- **Passthrough Mode**: Zero-copy routing for Anthropic→Anthropic with 100% API fidelity (preserves extended thinking, includes session recording)
- **Streaming Support**: Full SSE streaming for real-time responses from both providers
- **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests based on rules, health, and cost optimization
- **Session Recording**: Capture and replay all LLM interactions with GDPR-compliant IP anonymization
- **Session Statistics**: Track per-session tokens (input/output/thinking), request counts, and proxy overhead
- **PII Detection & Redaction**: Automatically detect and redact sensitive information
- **Budget Management**: Track and enforce spending limits across providers
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failover and retry logic
- **High Performance**: Built in Rust for minimal latency overhead (p95 < 35ms), with detailed timing metrics
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and logging

## Architecture

LunaRoute is organized as a Rust workspace with the following crates:

- **lunaroute-core**: Core types and trait definitions
- **lunaroute-ingress**: HTTP ingress adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **lunaroute-egress**: Provider connectors (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **lunaroute-routing**: Routing engine with health monitoring and circuit breakers
- **lunaroute-session**: Session recording and replay
- **lunaroute-storage**: Storage abstractions (config, sessions, state)
- **lunaroute-pii**: PII detection and redaction
- **lunaroute-observability**: Metrics, tracing, and health endpoints
- **lunaroute-server**: Production server binary with configuration file support
- **lunaroute-cli**: Command-line interface (`lunaroute`)
- **lunaroute-integration-tests**: End-to-end integration tests
