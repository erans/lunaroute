# LunaRoute

**Intelligent LLM API Gateway**

LunaRoute is a high-performance API gateway for Large Language Model providers, written in Rust. It provides intelligent routing, session recording, PII detection, budget management, and unified API translation between different LLM providers.

## Features

- **Unified API Translation**: Seamlessly translate between OpenAI and Anthropic API formats
- **Streaming Support**: Full SSE streaming for real-time responses from both providers
- **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests based on rules, health, and cost optimization
- **Session Recording**: Capture and replay all LLM interactions
- **PII Detection & Redaction**: Automatically detect and redact sensitive information
- **Budget Management**: Track and enforce spending limits across providers
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failover and retry logic
- **High Performance**: Built in Rust for minimal latency overhead (p95 < 35ms)
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and logging

## Architecture

LunaRoute is organized as a Rust workspace with the following crates:

- **lunaroute-core**: Core types and trait definitions
- **lunaroute-ingress**: HTTP ingress adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **lunaroute-egress**: Provider connectors (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **lunaroute-routing**: Routing engine with health monitoring and circuit breakers
- **lunaroute-session**: Session recording and replay
- **lunaroute-storage**: Storage abstractions (config, sessions, state)
- **lunaroute-pii**: PII detection and redaction
- **lunaroute-observability**: Metrics, tracing, and health endpoints
- **lunaroute-cli**: Command-line interface (`luna`)
- **lunaroute-demos**: Demo server for testing the gateway
- **lunaroute-integration-tests**: End-to-end integration tests

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.90+ with Rust 2024 edition support
- cargo

### Development

```bash
# Check all crates
make check

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run lints
make lint

# Build release binaries
make build

# Run the CLI
make run ARGS="--help"

# Install git hooks
make install-hooks
```

### Running the Demo Server

Try the working gateway with the included demo:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Run the demo server
cargo run --package lunaroute-demos

# In another terminal, test it:
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# Test with streaming:
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

The demo server accepts OpenAI-compatible requests and proxies them through the LunaRoute gateway. Streaming is fully supported for real-time responses.
